# CRUD MENU USER GUIDELINES
CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete and is used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate users to view, search, and change information on data using computer-based forms and reports. In the CRUD menu-based mutation database, all activities to add, search, edit, and delete data are carried out on the Mutation menu to make it more systematic.
